        question: "What does it mean HealthFROGS is Trust Partner?",
        answer: `
            In healthcare, the business and technology challenges are innumerable. It is hard for healthcare customers to find a suitable solution partner in this fast-paced business world. Also, more than one solution partner may be required to address the holistic solution for the healthcare problem. The spent is astronomical, as well as the spillover.  On the other hand, numerous innovative and dynamic healthcare solution partners exist globally who have the right-fit healthcare solutions (products and services), but need help ith customer reach out and connections. HealthFROGS brings both Healthcare customers and HealthFROGS solution partners or solution partner ecosystems to address the business challenges with a focus on FROGS (Finance, Regulation, Operations, Growth, Strategy).  HealthFROGS performs as a catalytic agent to build and thicken the Trust between customers and solution partners by reducing the hunting and establishing time and cost from both sides. Having HIPAA, PHI, and SOX compliance in place, HealthFROGS ensures data security and safety based on USA regulations and compliance.
